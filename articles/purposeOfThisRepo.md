A couple years ago I was listening to a podcast where the podcaster mentioned the importance of giving back and creating value from what you are learning in your day to day. I took this to heart at that time I was working as a developer and began to write articles on different platforms, including linkedin and Medium. I hoped to begin writing these articles on my own blog. At some point I didn't keep up with this work as I have never been a prolific writer. At the same time I love the idea that you can give back at the same time while you are learning your own life lessons in your career.

My attempt here is to document and share my thoughts and lessons that I am learning.

I am currently working in the role of a Engineering Manager at Mastercard. The concepts of bettering yourself while you work to better others rings loud in my mind. I am hopeful that as I journal/article/write my thoughts that someone else might find benefit from what I have to say.

Additionally, in a world full of budding AI authors, I imagine hearing the thoughts of a human can begin to feel few and far between. I am planning on retaining the thoughts of myself and only using AI for proofreading and word smithing. But rest assured this database of articles should remain pure of AI generated content.
