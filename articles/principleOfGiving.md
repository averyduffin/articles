# Principle of Giving

For those who play sports, this concept is probably familiar unless you participated in individual sports. As a teenager and young adult, I was a competitive swimmer. In the world of competitive swimming, everyone is your competitionâ€”at least, that's how I viewed it. The only way to win was to have someone slower than you. This type of competition discouraged the idea of teamwork or sharing knowledge, as even your teammates were considered rivals.

I first learned about the principle of giving when I started my degree in Electrical Engineering. Early on, I was so focused on my own work that if I finished or understood concepts, I would often leave my peers and continue with my busy schedule. However, as I progressed in my degree, I began to struggle with many different concepts. This forced me to rely on my peers for help. Our school had a place called the CADM lab, where engineers could study and work on assignments together. I began to realize the impact my peers had on me when they practiced the principle of giving without expecting anything in return. Looking back, I truly believe I would not have made it through my degree without great friends and helpful peers.

A few years ago, my father-in-law shared a talk with me given at BYU in 2009 by Arthur C. Brooks, titled "Why Giving Matters" (https://speeches.byu.edu/talks/arthur-c-brooks/giving-matters-2/). This talk had a profound effect on me, helping me realize the objective benefits of giving and adopting this principle in my life. Fast forward to today, as a manager, I see that the people and teams who adopt an attitude of genuinely giving and helping others are the ones who find the most joy and success in their work.

Recently, I had a meeting with an EVP in our organization who used the phrase, "the cream always rises to the top." In a business environment, it's easy to get caught up in the idea that making your peers look bad will help you climb the ladder quicker, talking people down will get you the next promotion, or holding everything close to your chest will make you indispensable to the company. While these patterns might help you make quick moves or give you job security, long-term success is always achieved by doing the right thing.

Don't expect that doing the right thing or giving without expectation won't be met with pain or disappointment. But in the long run, your career will be filled with success and joy if you choose to give and share.
